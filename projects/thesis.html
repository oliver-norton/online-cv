             <h2>QUANTIFYING POLARISATION ON A LARGE SCALE USING MACHINE LEARNING AND NETWORKS ANALYSIS</h2>

            <p>Political polarisation can harm democracy by causing division, gridlock, and limited voter choices, making it important to measure accurately. My research develops a new method to study polarisation in multiparty systems by analysing Twitter data, focusing on the 2022 French presidential election. The findings show that while overall polarisation is low, far-right supporters express more extreme views, and politically
                 active individuals tend to hold stronger opinions, offering insights into public opinion patterns.</p>

            <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <p>In my thesis I sought to: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Build a relevant text-based dataset of the 2022 French elections</li>
                <li>Quantify political polarisation using this dataset</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Dataset</h3>
            <p>
                A collection of over 5 million Tweets and 16 million retweets that I collected from a commercial API, Radarly. The period of time was a few weeks in April 2022. 
            </p>

            <h3>Summary/Highlights</h3>
            <h4>Data collection            </h4>
            <p>
                To collect the data I used a boolean query method based on key words related to the elections. A boolean search might be: “election” AND 
                “france” OR “macron”. To identify relevant keywords, and expand my dataset, I used a method called 
                computer assisted keyword expansion, which uses a lasso regression to predict which keywords were topic relevant based on log-likelihood.

            <h4>Quantifying polarisation            </h4>
            <p>
                I quantified polarisation using a type of variance called total variation, which is variance between not just two variables, but multiple. 
                In this case, I was measuring the variance between 
                the 4 main political parties. Two of these are those led by Marine Le Pen and President Emmanuel Macron respectively.

            <p>
            In the visual below you can see part of the results of the analysis. Each of the 4 political parties 
            lies at one of the tips of a tetratedron (3D triangle). The coloured histograms along the edges of the
             triangles show the distribution of public opinion with respect to any two parties.
