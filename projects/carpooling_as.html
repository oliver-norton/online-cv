            <p>
                As a data sceintist, understanding the software and data architecture that you 
                are working within is increasingly important, especially for roles that require
                 buildling machine learning and data pipelines in production. 


            </p>

            <h3>Goals:</h3>
            <p>In this case study, I sought to develop a data software architecture 
                for a fictional ridesharing company, Carpooling A/S. In this case, 
                Carpooling A/S has an existing on-premise software architecture, but wishes
                 to migrate to a cloud based solution, the likes of Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud.

                I needed to fulfil the following functional and non-functional requirements with the new system:                
            </p>

            <p>For this case study, I researched the topic extensively over a period of 72 hours. Here is a summary of my solution:

            <!-- <h4>Creating a dbt pipeline </h4>
            <p>
                To start, I used the Python library to generate the type 
                of data that an energy company would collect. Then, I used
                 dbt to transform the data and store it in a SQL database 
                  (DuckDB). This involved the following: 

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Transforming raw data using SQL queries to meet the requirements of my given case                 </li>
                <li>Creating comprehensive data models and schema for structuring data</li>
                <li>Implementing testing and quality checks to ensure data integrity    </li>
                <li>Utilising Git for version control to manage project changes </li>
            </ul> -->

            <h4>Automating the data pipeline            </h4>
            <p>
                To automate, I needed to containerise the enivronment in which I had written 
                the Python script, a (optional) bash script and the dbt project. 
                To do this, I created a container using Docker, incorporating all the 
                elements in the ELT / ETL process. Then, I used GitHub actions to activate the container process. 

                Visualising the transformed data

            
            </p>

            <h4> Visualising the transformed data    </h4>
            <p>I used Power BI to visualise the transformed data produced in the project:            </p>

            In the visual below you can see part of the results of the analysis. Each of the 4 political parties 
            lies at one of the tips of a tetratedron (3D triangle). The coloured histograms along the edges of the
             triangles show the distribution of public opinion with respect to any two parties.
